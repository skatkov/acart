        Commission Hijacking Protection
      </h3>

      <p>
       Many affiliate marketing networks often warn their users against malware that can replace one affiliate link with another affiliate link in an attempt to steal commissions. aCart.to is a way to protect your affiliate ID by putting your affiliate link shortened, so people can't see your ID, which makes a lot harder to do Commission hijacking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the actual Commission protecting benefit, it makes your URL look a bit more trustworthy.
      </p>

      <h3 class="py-4 text-xl text-gray-600">
        100% safe for Amazon Associates
      </h3>

      <p>
        Just be sure to follow the <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies#Associates%20Program%20Participation%20Requirements">program guidelines</a> and do not use your links to deceive your visitors. Clearly indicate that Amazon is the destination using either text next to your link, wording that is part of the linked text, or a button image for the link. Eg, "Buy at Amazon".
      </p>

      <h3 class="py-4 text-xl text-gray-600">
        Doesn't Amazon forbid short linking?
      </h3>

      <p>
        This confusion stems around definition of "cloaking" and some horrifying language in the <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/agreement/">Amazon Associates Operating Agreement</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="my-4 pl-6 italic border-l-4">
        "You will not cloak, hide, spoof, or otherwise obscure the URL of your Site containing Special Links (including by use of Redirecting Links) or the user agent of the application in which Content is displayed or used such that we cannot reasonably determine the site or application from which a customer clicks through such Special Link to the Amazon Site."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This line states that you can't use links that obscure the referring site, preventing Amazon from seeing where clicks originated. <b>aCart.to is not a cloaking service and preserves referrer information and passes it on to Amazon with each click.</b>
