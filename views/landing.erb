        It can produce <strong>very short links</strong> and <strong>include associate tag</strong> as any other shortener. But what
        sets aCart.to apart from the rest:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 pb-6">
        <li>Short link in 2 clicks without leaving Amazon Product page</li>
        <li>Bundle multiple products into a single link</li>
        <li>Link will redirect to a checkout page adding products to a cart</li>
        <li>Once at checkout, user can remove item completely, change quantity or continue to browse amazon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pb-6">
        Example:
        <a href="https://acart.to/V" class="text-blue-500 underline">https://acart.to/V</a>
      </p>

        100% safe for Amazon Associates
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Just be sure to follow the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies#Associates%20Program%20Participation%20Requirements">program guidelines</a> and do not use your links to deceive your visitors.</li>
        <li>Clearly indicate that Amazon is the destination using either text next to your link, wording that is part of the linked text, or a button image for the link. Eg, "Buy at Amazon".</li>
      </ul>

        doesn't Amazon forbid short linking?
      </h3>

      <p>
        It stems from confusion around the definition of "cloaking" and some scary-looking language in the Amazon Associates guidelines:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "You will not cloak, hide, spoof, or otherwise obscure the URL of your Site containing Special Links (including by use of Redirecting Links) or the user agent of the application in which Content is displayed or used such that we cannot reasonably determine the site or application from which a customer clicks through such Special Link to the Amazon Site."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This line from the Amazon.com Associates Operating Agreement just states that you cannot use links that obscure the referring site, preventing Amazon from seeing where clicks originated. aCart.to conforms to this by preserving the referrer information and passing it on to Amazon with each click.
